If you enjoyed SuperTuxKart and would like to help the project, or just to say thank you, you may donate to help us! SuperTuxKart now uses itch.io to receive donations. Click on the "Download Now" button and you will be able to select your donation amount.

Donations help us improve the game, as they may be used for purchasing hardware, file hosting and distribution services, servers to host websites, paying artists to produce improved artwork, and more. You can learn more about our policy [here](Donation_Policy).

**Do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or problems!**

Alongside SuperTuxKart 1.5, a donation package including two tracks developped for SuperTuxKart Evolution - Drainage Dash and Freytra Peaks - is available for donations of 5$ or more.

To install the package, first retrieve the "1.5 Gift Package" on itch.io, unzip the file, and follow the instructions in the included README. The procedure follows the [manual addons installation](Installing_Add-Ons) procedure.

Unfortunately as of now, we are not able to offer an in-game installation procedure or a simple installation procedure for Android users. We are aware of this limitation, but we didn't want to delay 1.5's release to all users to solve it.

{% include character_presentation name="Sven: Lead Artist" type="even" description="Sven started to play STK in 2016 on a very old PC. Because of that he could only play the 0.8.1 version, although at that time 0.9.2 was the newest one. But still he started to learn blender to create his own tracks. After several addons, Black Forest was his first track used in the main game, and he has gone on to improve his artistic skills. He is now working on many new tracks that will feature in SuperTuxKart Evolution." icon="/assets/wiki/Sven_icon.png" %}
